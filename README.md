Use to update LDAPS certificate with LetsEncrypt certificate automatically.


### DESCRIPTION
- Use this script to automatically and apply a LetsEncrypt certificate to Azure Active Directory Domain Services (AADDS).
- This should be run on a bi-weekly or monthly basis and will enable LDAPS and external access for LDAPS.
- This script requires the Posh-ACME module. Be sure to install the module.
- This script is currently designed to be run as an Azure Automation Runbook.
- You will need to make the RunAs account a global/tenant administrator.

### PARAMETER contact

### PARAMETER dnsProvider
